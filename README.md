Basic Search App by Chris Wilkes

App for searching the top-rated movies by title, genre, year, or cast member built with Algolia Instant Search. The date range can also be specified. A user is also able to specify genre and date range whilst searching for a specific actor, for example, comedy films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 90s (there are five). 

to run please do the following:

`npm install`

`npm run`


Project notes:

I built this app using the quick start guide provided by Algolia. Docs were great and getting up and running was easy. I'm happy with the functionality of the app. CSS took a little time to get my head around so I think the docs could be improved there. 

What I would've liked to have added was expanding cast lists for each hit, with a click on an actor's name leading to a new search of that attribute for all films they've starred in but, alas, I ran out of time. Another neat addition would be to build a webscraper to keep it fresh rather than have only a static index.

On the whole I enjoyed working on this app, and I'm super impressed by the product Algolia has built. Thouroughly enjoyed using it, and loved the super fast speeds.

Question 1:

Hi George 

No worries, I'm here to help. 

So in the context of search engines ('record' can have slightly different meanings depending on context') a record is a group of fields within a table relevant to a specific idea, person, corporation, or whatever. For example, in a table called customer contact information, a row would likely contain fields such as: ID number, name, street address, city, telephone number etc. This would be a record, and a database is often made up of many records. 

In general terms, indexing refers to the organisation of data according to a specific schema. Again, as with records, the term has various uses such as making information more presentable and accessible. This is particulary important for search engines as easily accessible information is quicker to retrieve. Without an index a search engine would to go through every document available to it, rather than consult the index for results. 


As you probably know, custom rankings are a great way of helping you achieve your business goals due to the control it provides over the way search results are served to your customers. As you're looking to maximise the value to your customers important info like number of sales, views or likes is extremely useful. Attributes like ratings or dates of release can also be used. All of the above will allow you to maximise your goals by encouraging dwell time on your site, increasing product views etc, all of which leads to increased sales.

Hopefully the above info has helped clarify a few things for you. Please don't hesitate to reach our if you have further questions, I'd be more than happy to help.

Have a great day!


Q2



Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.


Hi Matt

Thanks for reaching out. Firstly, please dont stress about the feedback. We thrive on customer feedback, both positive and negative, as it allows our product to get even better. So please keep it coming! 

I understand that it must be a little frustrating having to click a million times to get simple tasks done. We have a solution for you though. Algolia's API allows you to delete multiple indices at once with just a few lines of code. I beleive that it would streamline your workflow significantly. have a look here: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-your-indices/how-to/deleting-multiple-indices/. 

As you can see there are multpiple languages you can use, so pick one you're most comfortable in. The API is a great tool for automating mundane tasks. I'd be happy to walk through any issues you might have getting started, so please let me know if you need help.

I hope you find the above useful.

Have a great day, and thanks again for the feedback.




Question 3:

Hi Leo

Great question, thanks for reaching out. 

As Algolia handles most of the back-end heavy lifting, the bulk of the work is down to the redesign and rejigging of the User Experience of visitors to your site. As such most of the development work has already been done for you.  You and your developers should be able to get up and running within days, if not hours. We'd be happy to help you with examples and best practice around implementing Algolia.

The first steps are creating indices for your searchable data and uploading it to Algolia. Then, either through the dashboard or API, you can begin to configure how search results are displayed, what metrics to gather, analyses to be performed etc. Once that is completed you can begin building into your site the search functionality that Algolia provides, made even easier by using our front-end widgets as well as many integrations with popular frameworks and platforms. This very simple process is detailed here (alongside extensive documentation on all Algolia's features and functions): https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/ 

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be more than happy to help.
