Basic Search App by Chris Wilkes

App for searching the top-rated movies by title, genre, year, or cast member built with Algolia Instant Search. The date range can also be specified. A user is also able to specify genre and date range whilst searching for a specific actor, for example, comedy films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 90s (there are five). 

to run please do the following:

`npm install`

`npm run`


Project notes:

I built this app using the quick start guide provided by Algolia. Docs were great and getting up and running was easy. I'm happy with the functionality of the app. CSS took a little time to get my head around so I think the docs could be improved there. 

What I would've liked to have added was expanding cast lists for each hit, with a click on an actor's name leading to a new search of that attribute for all films they've starred in but, alas, I ran out of time. Another neat addition would be to build a webscraper to keep it fresh rather than have only a static index.

On the whole I enjoyed working on this app, and I'm super impressed by the product Algolia has built. Thouroughly enjoyed using it, and loved the super fast speeds.
